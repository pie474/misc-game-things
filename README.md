# Miscellaneous games and animations, some of which work!

# maze-chaze:

generate a random maze with pellets that you eat, with an enemy that also moves around randomly. IF you get close to him, then he just grows bigger and bigger, smashes through the maze walls to get to you and eats you.

# self-solving-maze:

randomly generated maze where each pixel of the maze wall tries to get to the exit by following the walls of the maze. Mostly done to see what patterns emerge as the maze pixels start moving around.

# Launchpad:

recreation of the midi launchpad instrument. Has a grid of buttons where each button corresponds to a different sound clip. Hit buttons, make music.

# AGAR_IO.py:

simplified version of the popular web game

# Classic 2d mario.py:

Recreation of the mario game.  Much of the physics works!!

# sack-physix:
